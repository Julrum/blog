# Bandit Level 25 → Level 26

## Level Goal

Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not **/bin/bash**, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

## Commands you may need to solve this level

`ssh`, `cat`, `more`, `vi`, `ls`, `id`, `pwd`
