# Bandit Level 21 → Level 22

## Level Goal

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

## Commands you may need to solve this level

`cron`, `crontab`, `crontab(5)` (use `man 5 crontab` to access this)
